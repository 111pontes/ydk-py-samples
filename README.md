# Sample Apps for YDK-Py
This repository provides a collection of sample applications that use [YDK-Py](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/ydk-py) for network programmability.  YDK-Py is the Python package for the Cisco YANG development kit (YDK) which provides model-driven APIs generated from a variety of YANG models.  

Sample apps are classified as either basic or intermediate.  The have the following characteristics:
* Basic apps: focus on a single model and have no or minimal programming logic (conditionals, loops, etc).  They should be your starting point if you don't have strong experience with models or with programming.  They are grouped by model.

* Intermediate: may have some programming logic and combine more than one model.  They are classified separately by use case.

## Installation
Before running any app, make sure you are using the Python 2.7 interpreter installed:
```
$ python -v
```
Then, [download](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/ydk-py/archive/master.zip) the package and follow the installation instructions in the README file.

## Running an App
Instructions for using the basic apps can be found in their [README](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/ydk-py-samples/etree/master/samples/basic) file.
